    <h1>Welcome to my personal page.</h1>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  I'm a self-taught aspiring Data Engineer with a strong background in <strong>philosophy, theology, and classical languages</strong> — especially Latin and Greek. You'll find traces of that classical mindset woven throughout my projects, particularly in my <em>Classic Book ETL Pipeline</em>.
</p>
<p>
  I also bring significant real-world experience from the <strong>retail business</strong>, where I've managed stock, worked closely with customers and suppliers, and kept things moving — even in fast-paced, chaotic environments. If you ever have a question about Makita or Bahco tools, feel free to ask (seriously — blink and I’ll be there!).
</p>
<p>
  I still work full-time at the retail store, but every morning before work, I’m training hard — developing skills in <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>, and modern data tools. My goal is to break into tech and build a meaningful career in data engineering.
</p>
