## Welcome – I’m Juan D. Bravo

I’m a **self-taught junior Data Engineer**, passionate about learning new skills and driven by the desire to build meaningful systems.

Since *January 2025, I’ve been hands on learning Data Engineering while working full-time. In April, I began pushing projects to GitHub — steadily turning knowledge into practice.

I’m a career changer in my mid-thirties. I currently work as an Operations Specialist in a wholesale industrial supply store, where I’ve learned the behind-the-scenes impact of business systems.

Before this, I spent nine years in a monastery, where I studied Philosophy, Theology, Latin, and Greek. That background taught me discipline, deep focus, and the value of order — traits I now bring into the world of data world. You may find scattered traces of that journey across my work.
